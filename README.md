## 🧠 Why Multiple Versions?

Each project is intentionally rebuilt using different technologies to clearly show:

- How **architecture changes** as complexity increases
- Differences in **state management approaches**
- Benefits of **component-based design**
- Advantages of **type safety with TypeScript**
- Framework vs library trade-offs
- Real-world **build and deployment workflows**
- And obviously to showcase my learnings

This mirrors how developers grow in real production environments.
